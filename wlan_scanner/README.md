# Rust Ratatui WLAN Scanner that does no scanning!

This is the state of the code at the end of the Rust Ratatui compo on Thursday 2025.10.09.

The plan was to write a WLAN Scanner, but in the ~60 or so minutes I had, and having never written a Ratatui project,
this was as far as I got. I prepared my environment before the compo, performed a test compile of the template, and had
a chat with Claude.ai about plans, but did not begin coding until the evening of the Meetup, as starting early would
have been cheating IMHO.

If I win an ESP32 T-Display, I will finish the project and upload it for everyone to share.
