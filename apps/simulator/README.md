# Simulator

Run mousefood apps on your computer inside a simulator!

Uses [embedded-graphics-simulator](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics-simulator).

## Requirements

This app requires [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) to be installed.

If you use [nix](https://nixos.org) you can run `nix-shell -p SDL2` before running the application.

## Run

To start this demo, simply run:

```shell
cargo run -p
```

A window will open with the simulator running.
