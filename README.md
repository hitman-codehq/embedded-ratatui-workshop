# Building Pocket-Sized Terminal UIs with Rust 🦀👨‍🍳

> Ratatui is a Rust library for building fast and modern terminal UIs, now capable to run even on your toaster!
>
> In this talk, Orhun Parmaksiz (open source developer and maintainer of Ratatui) will take us on a whirlwind tour of what Ratatui is capable of, from system tools and games to musical instruments. After that, we will jump into a hands-on workshop where we will build a TUI application from scratch and use Ratatui's newly added no_std support to run it on a tiny display that fits in your pocket! (ESP32 T-Display)
>
> We will also host a fun mini-competition where the top 3 workshop projects, as voted by participants, will get to keep the device.
>
> Join us for a session packed with awesome terminal UIs and hands-on hacking with embedded Rust!

## Schedule

The workshop is meant to be completed **in 2 hours.**

First 30 minutes will be [a presentation](https://github.com/orhun/embedded-ratatui-talk) about Ratatui and embedded Rust, followed by a 90-minute hands-on workshop.

## Workshop Preparation

If you don't have everything set up, I'm afraid we won't have enough time to do hacking during the [workshop](./README.md).

So please make sure to complete the steps in [PREPARATION.md](./PREPARATION.md) before the workshop!

## Templates

There is a template project in the [`template/`](./template) folder that you can use as a starting point.

Each file is well documented to help you understand what is going on.

## Show and Tell

Join the [Ratatui Discord](https://discord.gg/pMCEU9hNEj) and share your creations with the other terminal chefs!

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask there as well!
